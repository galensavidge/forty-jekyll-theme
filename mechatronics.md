	<p>CMPE118, referred to most as "mech," is maybe the most infamous class at UCSC. Students from all the school's engineering disciplines know its reputation as a sort of temporal vortex which sucks in friends and colleagues. A cornerstone of the class is its final project, in which student teams build autonomous robots to compete against one another in instructor-designed games.</p>
