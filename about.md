<p>I am an engineering student and jazz pianist based in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. I play piano for events and businesses, both as a solo performer and in groups. I am also persuing a career in engineering, building off of my background in robotics. I am specifically interested in aerospace applications of robotic and mechatronic systems.</p>

				<h3>Engineering</h3>
			</header>
			<p>I've loved building things for as long as I can remember. I was the type of kid who often spent hours at a time tinkering with LEGO or other types construction projects, and the desire to tinker and create did not diminish as I aged. That interest in building and creative problem solving has fit robotics, my academic area of study, very well. I have also had a nearly lifelong interest in space travel and aerospace technology. Pursuing this interest, I am now working on a <a href="{% link slugsat.md %}">microsatellite senior design project</a>, which has provided invaluable perspective into what is involved in the development of a spacecraft. I plan to continue to work in the aerospace industry post-graduation.</p>

				<h3>Music</h3>
			</header>
			<p>I started playing piano in 2007, and jazz around 2009. Since then, I have had the pleasure of playing with a collection of well known musicians in the Bay Area jazz scene, including <a href="http://www.abcarian.com/main/" target="_blank">Ravi Abcarian</a>, <a href="https://richardhowellandsuddenchanges.com/" target="_blank">Richard Howell</a>, <a href="https://www.maxschwartzmusic.com/" target="_blank">Max Schwartz</a>, <a href="https://www.montereysymphony.org/person-stan-poplin-42.htm" target="_blank">Stan Poplin</a>, and <a href="http://ashwinbatish.com/" target="_blank">Ashwin Batish</a>, among others. My Santa Cruz-based jazz trio Triumvirate has released <a href="{% link discography.md %}">two albums</a> featuring <a href="http://www.keshavbatish.com/home-2/" target="_blank">Keshav Batish</a> and Gabe Meacham.</p>

				<h3>Early Life</h3>
			</header>
			<p>I grew up in Berkeley, California. I homeschooled for some of my early academic career, an experience which taught me the value of curiosity and independent learning. After graduating from Berkeley High School in 2014, I was intrigued by the Jack Baskin School of Engineering and the jazz minor at UC Santa Cruz, and decided to attend UCSC for my bachelor's.</p>
